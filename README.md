## Introduction
This repository provides a working MATLAB and Python script of Algorithm 1 in Ref. [1]. The purpose of this repository is to provide a minimum working version of the pseudoalgorithm so that the analyst/practitioner may easily adopt this parameterization of positive-definite matrices for their Lyapunov control laws.

## Instructions
The inputs to each script are the eigenvalues and angular parameters. The number of eigenvalues determines the size of the parameter matrix, i.e., providing 4 eigenvalues gives a $4\times4$ parameter matrix. This also determines the number of angles that need to be provided. If the number of eigenvalues is $N$, then there should be $(N^2-N)/2$ angles provided.
